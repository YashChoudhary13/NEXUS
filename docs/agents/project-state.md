- **Last updated:** 2026-07-13
- **Repo:** NEXUS — fork of Craft Agents. Baseline: upstream commit `4289b16` (v0.11.1).
- **Branch:** `main`. Working tree: documentation work is **uncommitted** (see Blockers).
- **Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation) nearly complete → preparing Phase 1 planning.
  Roadmap: [`../product/roadmap.md`](../product/roadmap.md).

## Where we are right now

The master product plan (**NEXUS = Chat + Swarm + Brain**) was adopted 2026-07-13 —
canonical snapshot at
[`../product/nexus-master-plan-2026-07-13.md`](../product/nexus-master-plan-2026-07-13.md).
Phase 0 (fork, run, audit, document) is nearly done. **No product source code has been
modified** — all work so far is investigation, validation, planning, and documentation.

## Done ✅

- Fork verified: `origin` → `YashChoudhary13/NEXUS`, `upstream` → `craft-ai-agents/craft-agents-oss`.
- Full read-only architecture audit → [`../architecture/craft-baseline.md`](../architecture/craft-baseline.md).
- Verified environment + baseline validation (Bun 1.3.10; builds ✅, shared tests ✅, failures
  categorized) → [`../development/testing-and-quality-gates.md`](../development/testing-and-quality-gates.md).
- Craft-coupling map (retained identifiers vs. later decoupling) → [`../development/upstream-sync.md`](../development/upstream-sync.md).
- Branding/compliance **PR #1 plan finalized** (owner-scoped, not yet implemented) →
  [`../plans/pr-01-identity-and-packaging.md`](../plans/pr-01-identity-and-packaging.md).
- Decisions D-001…D-018 recorded → [`../decisions/initial-product-decisions.md`](../decisions/initial-product-decisions.md).
- **2026-07-13:** master plan adopted; entire `docs/` system rebuilt to the canonical NEXUS
  structure (this documentation set). Root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` rewritten as thin shared
  bootstraps.

## Next up ⏭️ (in order)

1. **Close out Phase 0** ([`../plans/phase-0-foundation.md`](../plans/phase-0-foundation.md)):
   - Interactive launch smoke-test of the unmodified app (`bun run electron:dev`) — builds
     pass, but a human-visible launch hasn't been performed yet.
   - Owner: approve committing this documentation set (branch + PR per D-010).
2. **Produce the detailed Phase 1 implementation plan** (multi-account chat foundation) —
   scope in [`../plans/phase-1-multi-account-chat.md`](../plans/phase-1-multi-account-chat.md).
   The master plan calls this the gate before any feature work.
3. **PR #1 (branding/compliance)** — plan approved, **blocked on owner artwork** (D-008) and
   explicit go-ahead. Runs on its own branch, independent of Phase 1 planning.
4. Then: memory foundation → Phase 2 Swarm → Phase 3 Brain, per the roadmap.

## Blockers / owner input needed

- ⏳ **Uncommitted docs:** this entire documentation system sits uncommitted in the working
  tree on `main`. Needs owner go-ahead for a branch + commit (D-010 forbids direct `main`
  commits).
- ⏳ **PR #1 artwork** (app icon master + wordmark) — owner is providing (D-008).
- ⏳ **PR #1 implementation go-ahead.**
- ❓ Open questions listed in [`../product/roadmap.md`](../product/roadmap.md) §Open questions.

## Fast facts

- Runtime **Bun 1.3.10**; `bun install --frozen-lockfile` fails (stale lockfile — inherited).
- Storage is filesystem (JSONL sessions, JSON config, one AES-256-GCM credentials file). No SQL DB.
- Two agent backends today `[UPSTREAM]`: Claude Agent SDK (`anthropic`) + Pi SDK (`pi`, ~20 providers).
- Renderer ↔ logic is **WebSocket RPC**, not Electron IPC.
- Trademark requires rename/re-icon/re-bundle-ID before distribution → PR #1.

## Changelog / handoff log (newest first — append, never rewrite)

- **2026-07-13 — Docs system v2 (canonical NEXUS structure).** Adopted the master plan
  (Chat/Swarm/Brain) as authoritative; rebuilt `docs/` into the required structure
  (product/architecture/decisions/development/research/plans/upstream/agents); recorded
  decisions D-011…D-018 from the plan; rewrote root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` as thin
  bootstraps. **Note:** the previous `docs/` folder (including tracked `docs/cli.md`) had been
  deleted from the working tree before this rebuild; `cli.md` content was restored from git
  HEAD to [`../upstream/cli.md`](../upstream/cli.md). Everything remains uncommitted pending
  owner direction.
- **2026-07-13 — PR #1 plan finalized.** Owner approved incremental-evolution strategy and
  scoped PR #1 (product-name-only copy D-007; owner-supplied artwork D-008). Implementation
  not started.
- **2026-07-13 — Verified baseline.** Bun 1.3.10 installed; `bun install` (plain) works;
  builds + shared tests green; failures categorized (stripped OSS files vs. real lint debt vs.
  env). `bun.lock` was transiently modified and restored — tree left clean.
- **2026-07-13 — Orientation audit.** Full repo audit (architecture, security, frontend,
  coupling) completed read-only; no code changed.
